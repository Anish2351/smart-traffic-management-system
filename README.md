# Smart-traffic-management-system

## Introduction
This Repository contains a Project for Smart City Traffic Management. We, propose a Vision Based Efficient Solution for the same.

- Using Camera, We collect the Data from the Lanes i.e. Traffic (Number of Vehicles) in a single lane. Therefore, time for which Traffic Light would sign Green for a lane would be Proportional to the amount of Traffic in it.
For Detecting Vehicles, we use YOLOv3 which can Process upto 45 fps.

- Also, The Lane Having an Emergency Vehicle in It, would be given Total Clearance i.e. There would no Red Light for the lane until that vehicle, clears the Lane.
The Classifier used to Classify if a vehicle is an Emergency Vehicle or not has been Trained using FastAI.

- The Main Project is Covered in Vision_Based_Smart_Traffic_management_system.ipynb and Emergency Vehicle Classification.ipynb contains Code to train your classifier.
